## FERC 881 and EMS
Thermal line limits are critical to many decisions made on the transmission grid.  Therefore, unsurprisingly, the need to exchange AARs affects many software systems used by utilities and other grid operators.  However, by far the most common among these are Energy Management Systems (EMS) that provide real-time monitoring and control of the transmission grid to control centers.  These systems are implemented by a diverse landscape of vendors, and are used by the vast majority of entities with operations responsibility for the transmission grid, including utilities, transmission companies, transmission owners, reliability coordinators, ISO/RTOs, and of course organizations with combinations of these roles.  There will need to be many EMS integrations with TROLIE.  

EMS systems have been around a long time, with their origins of current functional design dating to the mid-1970s.  Depending on the vendor, EMS technology may be fairly old, some of which significantly pre-dates REST.  Many EMS platforms have traditionally used older methods for data exchanges, such as SCADA protocols, custom TCP-based protocols, and ad-hoc file exchanges.  Representational State Transfer (REST), the technology used for TROLIE, _may_ be unfamiliar to engineers who regularly work on the EMS in what is often referred to as an operations technology (OT) environment.  This article aims to provide a brief introduction to REST from the perspective of an EMS/OT expert in the hopes of making TROLIE more accessible.  

## Why REST and OpenAPI?

While REST may be new (or rarely used) in some EMS systems, it certainly isn't new. It was first published in [academic literature in the
year 2000](https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm).

TROLIE is built on the philosophy that the adoption of REST vs traditional EMS-centric/OT exchange methods is an acceptable tradeoff due to the
upside that REST offers over these traditional methods. An entire
paper could be written purely on this subject as to the benefits of using REST
for this sort of complex data exchange. To summarize:

* REST is significantly easier to secure than either SCADA protocols or
  file-based exchanges. This aligns well to modern cyber-security architectures,
  but also provides several security benefits and architectural flexibility to
  transmission providers. It is ultimately a transmission provider's decision
  whether to run the API directly over the public internet or over dedicated
  channel such as a VPN or frame relay. Nothing in REST requires a dedicated
  channel.

* Data integrity and non-repudiation is much easier to achieve with REST,
  especially vs file exchanges.

* REST has established patterns for modeling complex data structures that would
  be awkward in SCADA-style exchanges like ICCP.

* REST has established patterns for making backward compatibility significantly
  easier than it would be for file exchanges without developing complex custom
  conventions.

* It will be significantly easier to scale the system in terms of both load and
  performance with REST than it would be with the more traditional exchange
  methods used in EMS.


While there are many good materials available for understanding the REST
architecture in detail, users of the TROLIE APIs do not need to be experts in
REST. From a user perspective, REST could be seen as a minor cognitive leap
from file exchanges, which this document will illustrate through examples.

### Why not ICCP?
The Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP), part of IEC standard
60870-6, is used frequently to integrate Reliability Coordinators' SCADA system
with member transmission owners' SCADA systems to capture all kinds of telemetry
data from the power grid.  It has traditionally been used for dynamic line
ratings / real-time AARs for selected lines as an emerging technology. ICCP
works well for this use case, as the rating of the line in real-time is
functionally much like any other telemetry. ICCP is reliable, mature, and
well-known, and will continue to be supported by many transmission providers as
a method for submitting real-time ratings. Even though TROLIE supports
real-time rating exchange, continued use of ICCP for real-time ratings is
compatible with the use of TROLIE. However, ICCP won’t scale well to handle the
forecasted data. There are a couple reasons for this:

* The data model is a significant mismatch. ICCP is designed around SCADA
  concepts, such as points and quality flags. It is difficult to create
  arbitrarily complex data structures, like a coordinated forecast, and link
  them together. There are also needs to provide various strings into this
  data, such as override reasons.

* Using ICCP for forecasts would result in a significant increase in the count
  of SCADA points. Across our customer base, GE sees increased pressure on
  SCADA systems due to other changes to the power grid. The increased
  configuration overhead and load on potentially overtaxed SCADA systems makes
  ICCP less attractive.

This is all in addition to considering the advantages of REST discussed above.

### Why not File Exchanges?

Unlike ICCP, file exchanges using common formats such as CSV, XML, and JSON do
allow for more complex data structures. The advantages to REST however over
file exchanges are all outlined above. In addition to these more abstract
advantages, the authors of TROLIE see a trend across the utility industry where
file exchanges are becoming a common source of failure and management expense
for backing infrastructure / IT teams. File exchanges, especially over
networks, imply the use of high-end shared storage devices.  These devices are
complex to maintain, secure, and operate redundantly across data centers, and
we've seen in practice are a common source of many of the application failures
utilities and other grid operators see in production.

## REST is a Document Exchange Over the Web

To understand this API, REST could simply be seen as the exchange of JSON
"files" over HTTP (or more precisely for production environments, HTTPS).
TROLIE API implementers host a server, which may be accessed over the HTTPS port
(443). As a user, one sends a JSON document to a URL, much like a website.
This act of sending, called a "request", includes the following:

* A URL, much like one would enter a web browser to visit a website.  This URL
  determines the operation of the API being invoked, as well as identifying
  information for the resource being edited. The URL may also include query
  parameters.

* A set of headers. These are key-value pairs that also provide metadata about
  the request.

* A "method" to be used against the resource. Methods are a built-in part of
  the HTTP protocol, and the typical standard methods are used by the TROLIE
  API. These include:

  - `GET` fetches a resource. `GET`s are generally queries.

  - `HEAD` only fetches HTTP response headers associated with a resource one
    would otherwise `GET`. This is for more advanced usage, often associated with
    caching. `HEAD` requests may be used to determine whether data returned by
    `GET` has changed without calling `GET`.

  - `POST` is used to create a new resource.

  - `PUT` is used to update a resource.

  - `PATCH` is used to partially update a resource. This is like `PUT` but
    implies that users don’t have to provide the whole document. Rather, the JSON
    document would include only the changes.

  - `DELETE`, intuitively, deletes a resource.

* A JSON document to be used as input, referred to as a request "body". This is
  only applicable for `POST`, `PUT` and `PATCH` requests.

In return, the server will respond back with a response. The response includes:

* A numeric status code, indicating success or failure of the request. TROLIE
  uses standard HTTP status codes.

* A set of response headers.  These are key-value pairs providing metadata of
  the response, much like the request headers.

* A JSON document, referred to as a response “body”, including either the data
  requested, or a list of errors or warnings. Not all operations return bodies.
  `HEAD` requests, for example, never return bodies on success.

While a toolkit is available in most modern languages for executing these
requests in a high-performance way in-memory, it may be convenient for users to
learn the API through file exchange. This is possible using the free
open-source tool [Curl](https://curl.se/). Curl is a command-line tool that may
be used to interact with REST APIs, including TROLIE, entirely using files.
Curl is included with most Linux distributions as well as MacOS. It may be
freely downloaded for Windows from the Curl website linked above. The examples
of usage in [Usage Examples](usage-examples.html) are done entirely using Curl.

## OpenAPI

In practice, modern REST APIs are documented using OpenAPI specifications.
These specifications dictate the operations that are available in the API, along
expected parameters, headers, response codes, and JSON schema for requests and
responses. This also includes documentation and descriptions of schema,
operations, and parameters. OpenAPI specifications are specified in files,
formatted using either YAML or JSON.  TROLIE provides an OpenAPI specification
using YAML, the more easily human-readable format.

Many tools are available to work with OpenAPI, both commercial and open source.
A good reference may be found at [here](https://openapi.tools/). Libraries are
available to work with REST and OpenAPI in most programming languages grid
operators are familiar with, including Python, Java, C#/.NET and others. The
TROLIE project recommends ratings providers use these tools to integrate their
systems with TROLIE.

As mentioned above, it is also possible to simply work with files using curl and
similar utilities. This is recommended to be used primarily for testing and
exploration purposes. Likewise, it is possible to invoke the GET operations of
the API simply by putting the appropriate URLs in a web browser.
