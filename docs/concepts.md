Since TROLIE stands for _Transmission **Ratings** and **Operating
Limits** Information Exchange_, we start there.

## Operating Limit, or simply _Limit_

System Operating Limit is a well-defined industry term, but the salient point
for TROLIE is that a Limit satisfies the most limiting of any provided
reliability criteria. Limits for Transmission Facilities are determined by the
Clearinghouse after considering all Ratings Proposals for the Power System
Resources associated with that Transmission Facility during a particular Period
of an Operational Window.  TROLIE defines limits and ratings (described below) in 
3 distinct time horizons, including near term "forecasts", real-time and (in future 
releases) seasonal limits.  

### Forecast Limits

Forecast limits refer to the 240-hour-ahead forecasted AAR data set
mandated by FERC order 881.  While this is a forecast of limits as they would be
in real-time, in practice these are often used for various processes involved in 
near-term planning of transmission services, including day-ahead markets and other 
look-ahead resource commitment processes, transmission scheduling and outage 
coordination.  

### Real-Time Limits

In addition to forecasts, TROLIE may also be used to exchange ratings within the 
current hour, either as an alternative or supplement to traditional telemetry 
protocols such as ICCP.  

These are assumed to be "real-time" limits, based on measurements
of ambient conditions as opposed to forecasts.  These limits will be 
used by Transmission Providers in real-time grid operations processes, 
such as state estimator and real-time markets.  The clearinghouse for real-time ratings
may be run more frequently than the one for forecast ratings to adapt to real-world 
conditions.  


## Rating

For TROLIE's purposes, a Rating is simply a **proposed** Limit for a Period of
an Operational Window from a Ratings Provider for a particular Power System
Resource.

### Recourse Ratings

For background the reader is directed to sections 180 and 182 of the FERC Order
881 Final Rule as well as [this paragraph](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2021-27735/p-1394)
from the pro forma Attachment M which states:

> "The Transmission Provider must use Seasonal Line Ratings as a recourse rating in the event that an AAR otherwise required to be used under this Attachment is unavailable."

Additionally, in section 180:

> "Further, while this provision establishes the seasonal line rating as the default recourse rating, the transmission provider retains the ability [...] to use a different recourse rating where the transmission provider reasonably determines such a rating is necessary to ensure the safety and reliability of the transmission system."

Here we are concerned with three circumstances that require might require a recourse rating:

1. A Ratings Provider cannot determine an AAR for a facility with a Ratings Obligation.
2. The Clearinghouse Provider is not in possession of a rating for a Ratings Obligation.
3. The Clearinghouse Provider determines that the rating in its possession is apparently inaccurate.

{: .nb }
> In no situation requiring a recourse rating does the TROLIE specification
> constrain or dictate a course of action. However, in order to have a *working
> definition* of "recourse rating" useful in documenting the specification, we
> examine anticipated uses of recourse ratings in the three circumstances
> identified in the preceding paragraph.

In the first case, under the assumption that the Clearinghouse Provider will
receive the rating, it is anticipated that the Ratings Provider shall send an
appropriate recourse rating, e.g., the effective seasonal rating, when the
Ratings Provider cannot determine an AAR.

The second and third cases might occur when there is a communication outage or
when the rating proposed by the Ratings Provider did not meet pre-coordinated
validation criteria such as timeliness or lying within reasonability bounds.
Regardless, in such circumstances the Clearinghouse Provider is obliged to use a
recourse rating. Typically, the recourse rating in these circumstances is
anticipated to be a rating provided by the Ratings Provider separately, such as
the effective seasonal rating, a verbal override, or even a previously
forecasted rating.

### Seasonal Ratings

Seasonal Line Ratings, or simply Seasonal Ratings in TROLIE, are based on the 
formal definition in the pro forma attachment M of FERC order 881, which states:

> (3) “Seasonal Line Rating” means a Transmission Line Rating that:

> (a) Applies to a specified season, where seasons are defined by the Transmission Provider to include not fewer than four seasons in each year, and to reasonably reflect portions of the year where expected high temperatures are relatively consistent.

> (b) Reflects an up-to-date forecast of ambient air temperature across the relevant season over which the rating applies.

> (c) Is calculated annually, if not more frequently, for each season in the future for which Transmission Service can be requested.

Seasonal ratings are used as [Recourse Ratings](#recourse-ratings) in a TROLIE context, as described above.  They also may be used for other purposes that go beyond the AAR timeline, 
such as planning and other long-term studies.  

Seasonal Ratings are defined against [Seasons](#seasons).  

## Power System Resource, or simply _Resource_

A term borrowed from CIM, in the context of TROLIE, a "Resource" is an object of
the exchange whose identity--the `resource-id`--and other details have been
pre-coordinated such that both parties can assign the ratings and/or limits
associated with the `resource-id` to a particular element in their network
model.

## Clearinghouse Provider

Clearinghouse Provider is how this specification refers to the entity that hosts
a TROLIE server for the purposes of collecting ratings from multiple Ratings
Providers for a large footprint in order to determine and disseminate Limits
Snapshots. Generally, this anticipated to be a Transmission Provider (FERC), such
as an ISO.

> "Clearinghouse Provider" along with "Ratings Provider" and "Ratings Obligation"
> are indeed terms introduced by TROLIE. Defining the specific roles in the
> exchange explicitly and using them ubiquitously is meant to reduce ambiguity
> and promote generality in the specification.

## Ratings Provider

A Ratings Provider is a role defined by this specification to be responsible for
a set of Ratings Obligations. Ratings Providers should typically implement
clients to interact with TROLIE servers to fulfill these obligations. In some
cases a Clearinghouse Provider might implement processes to obtain Ratings from
a Ratings Provider who does not implement a TROLIE client, submitting Ratings on
behalf of that Ratings Provider.


## Ratings Obligation

A Ratings Obligation is a pre-coordinated expectation to provide compliant
ratings for a given resource. Usually, this means providing forecast and
real-time AARs for that resource. Ratings Obligations are used to authorize
Ratings Proposals.

## Transmission Facilities

We refer the reader to the definitions provided by FERC and/or their
Transmission Provider's tariff, but it suffices here to understand a
Transmission Facility to be the power system resource that has its Limit
determined by the Clearinghouse. Typically, the Transmission Facility is a
transmission line or a transformer.

## Segments

For the purposes of the TROLIE specification, a Segment is a logical construct:
A Transmission Facility may be comprised of one or more Segments. A distinct
Ratings Provider is assigned to each Segment. This modeling is pre-coordinated
and is out of scope for TROLIE, so while a Transmission Facility is generally
expected to have at least one Segment, the `resource-id` of a Ratings Proposal
might nominate a Transmission Facility itself in some implementations.

In terms of TROLIE, ratings providers are obligated to provide rating data, in
the form of Proposals, against segments. On jointly owned lines or tie lines for
example, each stakeholder in the line (the Transmission Facility) may be
responsible for submitting Ratings Proposals against a different Segment in the
model allocated to that stakeholder.


## Ratings Proposals

Proposals are forecasted or real-time ratings values submitted to TROLIE against
a particular Segment. They are referred to as "Proposals", as they are inputs
to the limit "clearing" process internal to TROLIE server implementations that
will integrate them into a final in-use rating set. In-use limit Snapshots are
a distinct data set from Proposals. Proposals may be queried as well as
submitted, so that the rating provider's original input data is always kept
separately from the in-use ratings.

## Limits Snapshots

As implied above, Snapshots are generated in TROLIE server implementations based
on proposals and other inputs to generate in-use ratings for each Transmission
Facility. TROLIE allows for ratings providers to fetch the latest snapshot, aka
the latest "version" of the ratings data.

## Forecast Window

See [Forecast Windows](/articles/forecast-windows)

## Monitoring Sets

Monitoring Sets are named sets of power system objects that may be used to
filter ratings and limits returned by queries against these APIs. How Monitoring
Sets are defined is beyond the scope of the TROLIE specification, and it is
assumed that the sender and receiver have predefined the appropriate Monitoring
Sets.

A typical implementation might define a Monitoring Set for each Ratings
Provider, containing all of the power system objects of interest to that Rating
Provider, such as their owned and/or operated facilities as well as any
additional objects whose limits they might monitor. It is generally assumed that
the Ratings Provider's Monitoring Set would include all of the transmission
facilities or other power system objects for which they have a Ratings
Obligation as well as their so-called "tier 1" monitored elements.

Another typical Monitoring Set would be that which nominates the complete
footprint for the Transmission Provider. A natural choice for the
`monitoring-set` identifier is the NERC id of the entity that defines the
`monitoring-set`, if applicable.

## Seasons

According to pro forma attachment M of FERC 881, a season has the following definition:

> ... where seasons are defined by the Transmission Provider to include not fewer than four seasons in each year, and to reasonably reflect portions of the year where expected high temperatures are relatively consistent.

In practical terms, Transmission Providers have a wide variety of Seasons that they operate to.  
Even if seasons across two Transmission Providers have the same name, such as "summer", 
the start and end dates may differ.  TROLIE is designed to be agnostic to these definitions as much as
possible, so that the data may be exchanged in a more accurate and precise manner.  While seasonal "aliases"
such as "winter" may sometimes be provided as hints, seasonal rating schedules are ultimately defined in terms 
of start and end dates.  Queries and submittals of seasonal ratings are done in terms of start and end dates, and 
TROLIE servers may decide how to enforce their adherance to specific named seasons that they use.
