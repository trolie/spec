# Pulling into the Station--TROLIE 1.0 Nears Journey's End

The TROLIE 1.0 feature scope is essentially complete. We still have some tasks
to wrap up, including [documentation improvements](https://github.com/trolie/spec/milestone/8)
and [some small refinements to the media types](https://github.com/trolie/spec/milestone/7),
but the [use cases in 1.0 scope](#supported-use-cases) are satisfied by the current [spec](https://trolie.energy/spec).

Since our last [Community Post](../community-events/), we've accomplished a lot.

* Defined [RC-to-RC rating reconciliation](../articles/RC-to-RC-reconciliation.md) and the underlying
  [monitoring set reconciliation pattern](../articles/peer-monitoring-sets.md)
  which utilizes the affordances for [reading monitoring sets](https://trolie.energy/spec#tag/Monitoring-Sets)

* Defined a ["slim" media type pattern](../articles/media-types.md#slim-media-types) that optimizes the most
  common ratings and limits exchanges

* Defined operations for [temporary AAR exceptions](https://trolie.energy/spec#tag/Temporary-AAR-Exceptions)
  and [seasonal overrides](https://trolie.energy/spec#tag/Seasonal-Overrides)

* Incorporated myriad fixes and documentation improvements based on reviews with vendors.
