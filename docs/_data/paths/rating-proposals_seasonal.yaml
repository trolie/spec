  summary: Obtain seasonal rating proposal status
  description: |

    Used to obtain the status of the Seasonal Ratings proposal. The response is
    implicitly restricted to the requesting Ratings Provider's obligation.
    Accordingly, the caller can use this endpoint to check the state of their
    proposal submission.

    Note that the same status object is returned for each
    `patchSeasonalRatingsProposal`, so this endpoint may seem redundant.
    However, an anticipated use case for this `GET` endpoint is to support
    supervisor processes that are setup by the client to independently ensure
    the provider's process for rating submission if functioning properly. For
    example, the Rating Provider might have one program responsible for
    producing and submitting Seasonal Ratings via
    `patchSeasonalRatingsProposal`, while having a separate monitoring job that
    checks this endpoint regularly.

    Clients SHOULD perform Conditional `GET` using the `If-None-Match` header
    and the `ETag` of a previous `GET` response to poll this endpoint. Rate
    limiting is done on a per Ratings Provider basis, so requests from
    independent clients used by the same provider count against the same quota.
