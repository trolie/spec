    Obtain the Limits Forecast the Transmission Provider is currently using in
    Operations, relative to the current time. Clients SHOULD perform
    Conditional `GET` using the `If-None-Match` header and the `ETag` of a
    previous `GET` response. This operation uses media types to control
    verbosity of the data fetched. The default media type
    (application/vnd.trolie.forecast-limits-snapshot.v1+json) simply includes
    the rating data. For applications that need it, the media type
    application/vnd.trolie.forecast-limit-detailed-snapshot.v1+json may be requested,
    which also references the source proposals used to generate the snapshot, as
    well as reporting data from the ratings clearing process.
