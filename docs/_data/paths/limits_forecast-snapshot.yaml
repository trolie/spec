  description: >
    Obtain the Limits Forecast the Transmission Provider is currently using in
    Operations,  relative to the current time.   Clients SHOULD perform
    Conditional `GET` using the `If-None-Match` header and the `ETag` of a
    previous `GET` response. This operation uses media types to control
    verbosity of the data fetched.   The default media type
    (application/vnd.trolie.forecast-limit-set-slim.v1+json)  simply includes
    the rating data.  For applications that need it, the media type
    application/vnd.trolie.forecast-limit-set-detailed.v1+json may be
    requested,  which also references the source proposals used to generate the
    snapshot, as well as  reporting data from the ratings clearing process.
