      Obtain the Limits Forecast the Transmission Provider is currently using in
      Operations, relative to the current time.

      This operation uses media types to control verbosity of the data
      fetched. The default media type,
      `application/vnd.trolie.forecast-limits-snapshot.v1+json`, simply includes
      the rating data. For applications that need it, the media type
      `application/vnd.trolie.forecast-limits-detailed-snapshot.v1+json` may be
      requested, which also references the source proposals used to generate the
      snapshot, as well as reporting data from the ratings clearing process.

      Clients SHOULD perform Conditional `GET` using the `If-None-Match` header
      and the `ETag` of a previous `GET` response to poll this endpoint. Rate
      limiting is done on a per Ratings Provider basis, so requests from
      independent clients used by the same provider count against the same quota.

      Similar to [getLimitsForecastSnapshot](#tag/Forecasting/operation/getLimitsForecastSnapshot),
      except that it specifically returns only the latest **regionally** limiting ratings
      ([RLRs](https://trolie.energy/concepts#regionally-limiting-rating))
      used by the Transmission Provider.

      This is explicitly designed to be used when reconciling forecasts between Transmission Providers
      in order to generate globally limiting ratings ([GLRs](https://trolie.energy/concepts#globally-limiting-rating))
      for general use.  See the article on
      [RC-to-RC Reconciliation](https://trolie.energy/articles/RC-to-RC-reconciliation.html) for more details.

      Outside of this use case, most users should use
      [getLimitsForecastSnapshot](#tag/Forecasting/operation/getLimitsForecastSnapshot) to get globally
      limiting ratings.

      Clients SHOULD perform Conditional `GET` using the `If-None-Match` header
      and the `ETag` of a previous `GET` response to poll this endpoint. Rate
      limiting is done on a per Ratings Provider basis, so requests from
      independent clients used by the same provider count against the same quota.
