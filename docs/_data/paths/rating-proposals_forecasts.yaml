  summary: Obtain forecast proposal status
  description: |

    Used to obtain the status of the Ratings Forecast proposal. The response is
    implicitly restricted to the requesting Ratings Provider's obligation.
    Accordingly, the caller can use this endpoint to check the state of their
    proposal submission.

    Note that the same status object is returned for each
    `patchRatingForecastProposal`, so this endpoint may seem redundant. However,
    an anticipated use case for this `GET` endpoint is to support supervisor
    processes that are setup by the client to independently ensure the provider's process for
    rating submission if functioning properly. For example, the Rating Provider
    might have one program responsible for producing and submitting Ratings
    Forecasts via `patchRatingForecastProposal`, while having a separate
    monitoring job that checks this endpoint regularly.

    Clients SHOULD perform Conditional `GET` using the `If-None-Match` header
    and the `ETag` of a previous `GET` response to poll this endpoint. Rate
    limiting is done on a per Ratings Provider basis, so requests from
    independent clients used by the same provider count against the same quota.

  summary: Submit a Forecast Proposal
  description: |

    In every Forecast Window, a new area-wide Forecast Proposal is created on
    the TROLIE server of the Clearinghouse Provider. Each Ratings Provider then
    `PATCH`es the area-wide proposal with the forecasts for their respective
    Ratings Obligations. Any unmet Ratings Obligations will result in the
    Clearinghouse Provider using an appropriate Recourse Rating for those unmet
    obligations.

    For Ratings Providers with a natural split in their Ratings Obligations,
    e.g., geographic or control areas, the `PATCH` semantics afford the ability
    to submit multiple Forecast Proposals containing just proposals for the
    relevant resources, if they choose to do so. This affordance can also be
    leveraged to split a large proposal into one or more parts in cases where
    that is advantageous from a performance or reliable delivery perspective.
