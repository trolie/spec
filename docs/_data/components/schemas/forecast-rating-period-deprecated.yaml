description: >
  Forecast ratings data for a segment and period.  Includes status of the 

  proposal relative to this data, as well as rating values.  

  It also optionally may include a set of "branch-only" ratings.  

  While forecast ratings in the "values" fields should be based on

  ambient conditions, they may also be limited by current topology.  

  The ratings provider should take this into account when populating the 

  values field for the proposal.  


  However, since this is a forecast, the Transmission Provider may run various 

  look-ahead functions that change this topology such that it is no longer a
  limiting factor.  

  To accommodate these scenarios, a "branch-only" rating should be sent that
  does not factor in 

  topology.
