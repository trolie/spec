  title: Proposed Limit
  description: |

    Defines the limit. In practice, most exchanges will only support one kind of
    limit for proposals and snapshots. However, the specification supports
    defining limits on a per resource basis as well as limit types that are not
    anticipated to be used to implement Order 881. TROLIE server implementations
    must support at least one of these limit types and should return a well known
    `application/problem+json` response if they receive a proposal in an
    unsupported but valid limit type as defined here.
