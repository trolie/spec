description: |

  Superset of limit types. This schema represents a compromise for the most
  common 4GL programming languages, e.g., Java, C#, etc., that don't support
  algebraic data types and require a discriminator field to deserialize objects
  that have `oneOf` or `anyOf` schemas.

  This relaxed schema permits nonsensical representations, so runtime validation
  will be required by both server and client.
