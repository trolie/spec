        The ratings proposals provided by the Ratings Providers that were
        considered when determining the limits of the facility for a specific
        period.

        If `resource-id` is not provided for a proposal, the ratings proposal is
        assumed to be for the overall facility nominated by the `resource-id` of
        this limit.

        If it is provided, it corresponds to the [segment](https://trolie.energy/concepts#segments).
