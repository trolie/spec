  Contains a unique identifier for an object. Where practicable, using a URI is
  generally recommended. However there is no functionality defined by TROLIE
  that is contingent upon the properties or structure of a `generic-identifier`;
  they are effectively opaque in the exchange.

maxLength: 100
pattern: ^(.){0,500}$
