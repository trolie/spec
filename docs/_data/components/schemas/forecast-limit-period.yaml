proposal:
  type: object
  title: Forecasted Period
  description: |

    A Forecasted Period contains proposed limits for a power system object,
    e.g., a segment, that were forecasted for a particular Period in a Forecast
    Window. The status of the proposal as determined by the Clearinghouse is
    also included.

              Despite a proposal being accepted by TROLIE, the downstream
              Clearinghouse logic may still disqualify a proposal. This might
              occur if, for example, the upper and lower reasonability limits
              are not aligned between TROLIE and the Clearinghouse.  To aid
              troubleshooting, the specification requires that TROLIE instances
              explicitly indicate if the proposal was `Used` in the
              determination of the limit or was `Rejected`.
