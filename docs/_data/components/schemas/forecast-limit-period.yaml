  title: Forecasted Period
  description: |

    A Forecasted Period contains proposed limits for a power system
    object, e.g., a segment, that were forecasted for a particular Period
    in a Forecast Window. The status of the proposal as determined by the
    Clearinghouse is also included.

        Optional list of quantities used as input to the ratings determination.
        The particular information exchange determines which values may be expected
        as well as the conventions used to represent those values. This property
        is included to prescribe a way to include these inputs but

              If the `value` is dimensionless, this property should not be
              provided. Since we are not specifying which inputs shall be
              provided, we cannot specify a definitive list of units, but
              implementors are encouraged to use UnitSymbol from CIM when
              appropriate: The CIM may not include appropriate units for
              all inputs, e.g., wind speed.
