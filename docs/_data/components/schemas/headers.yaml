    For simplicity, a single Proposal media type is used for both requests and
    responses. The `provenance` object populated by the Ratings Provider in a
    request. The Clearinghouse implementation may record this information, but
    the response `provenance` should reflect the appropriate metadata from the
    Clearinghouse Provider's perspective. Concretely, in a request
    `provenance.provider` should be the Ratings Provider and in a response the
    `provenance.provider` should be the Clearinghouse Provider.
