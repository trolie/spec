  type: object
  description: >
    General type for ratings proposal that is mutable over time, such as forecasts
    and seasonal ratings.  

    Like the immutable proposal, it includes general fields created by the
    system.  

    Filling in these fields before posting may be ignored, or result in a 400
    error from TROLIE.  

    Properties include:

    * The time the proposal was last updated.  

    * The ratings provider that owns the proposal.  For mutable proposals such as
    those for forecasts or seasonal 
      ratings, the ID of the owning ratings provider is the ID of the proposal itself.
