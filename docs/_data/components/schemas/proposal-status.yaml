  Enumeration of the possible statuses of a proposal, or parts of a proposal. 
  Note that submissions of proposals do not

  set this value.  It is system-generated after submission.  The following
  values are possible:

  * *pending* indicates that the system has not yet processed this proposal.  

  * *accepted* indicates that the proposal has been accepted, and is now the
  basis for the associated ratings / limit
    snapshot.  
  * *superseded* indicates that the proposal was superseded to a more
  conservative rating.  This rating may have 
    come from another party, as may be the case on jointly owned equipment or tie lines, or it may have come from a 
    topological condition on the network such that some related equipment is now forcing a more conservative limit.  
  * *overridden* indicates that the proposal was overridden manually by an
  operator for the Transmission Provider.   
enum:
  - pending
  - accepted
  - superseded
  - overridden
