        Despite a proposal being accepted by TROLIE, the downstream
        Clearinghouse logic may still disqualify a proposal. This might
        occur if, for example, the upper and lower reasonability limits are
        not aligned between TROLIE and the Clearinghouse.  To aid
        troubleshooting, the specification requires that TROLIE instances
        explicitly indicate if the proposal was `Used` in the determination
        of the limit or was `Rejected`.
