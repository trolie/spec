  RFC 3339 date-time string with *no fractional seconds component* that
  designates a start or end to an operating period (such as an hour) that starts
  at a specified time. This will frequently be at the start of an hour, but may
  be finer-grained, such as every 30 minutes, should the Clearinghouse Provider
  choose.

  If the Transmission Provider is operating in EST, these are valid and
  equivalent values:

  * 2023-01-01T06:00Z
  * 2023-01-01T01:00-5:00
  * 2023-01-01T00:00-6:00
  * 2023-01-01T11:30+5:30

  The server should uniformly represent date-times in the operational time zone
  of the Clearinghouse Provider.
