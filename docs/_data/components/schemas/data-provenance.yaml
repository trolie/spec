type: object
description: |

  Provides information about where the associated representation came from. *No
  functional aspects of the exchange are contingent upon this data.* However,
  this information is meant to support debugging and application support use
  cases, so it is required, and implementors are encouraged to provide
  meaningful values.

  * `provider` identifies that entity, e.g., a Ratings Provider or Clearinghouse
    Provider, that created the object. The `provider`'s NERC id is recommended.
  * `last-updated` indicates the wall-clock time at the `provider` when the
    object was last modified. N.b. this is not when the message
    describing the object was sent or received, i.e., implementors should not
    simply insert the current timestamp here when preparing the object serialization.
  * `origin-id` is the identifier used by the `provider` to uniquely nominate
    the object. It is recommended but not required that this be a URI.
