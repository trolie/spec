          Optional list of quantities used as input to the ratings determination.
          The particular information exchange determines which values may be expected
          as well as the conventions used to represent those values. This property
          is included to prescribe a way to include these inputs.

                If the `value` is dimensionless, this property should not be
                provided. Since we are not specifying which inputs shall be
                provided, we cannot specify a definitive list of units, but
                implementors are encouraged to use UnitSymbol from CIM when
                appropriate: The CIM may not include appropriate units for
                all inputs, e.g., wind speed.
