  A network segment is a component of an transmission facility that may have a
  rating assigned to it.  

  These are generally line segments, but can really be any piece of equipment on
  the network that 

  can have a dynamic rating and is potentially limiting to some transmission
  facility.

      A condition on a given segment that may have specialized ratings against
      it.  

      This is typically used for underground cables that are next to each other
      in a tray.  

      If certain cables are switched on or off, it significantly changes the
      rating of the line (segment).
