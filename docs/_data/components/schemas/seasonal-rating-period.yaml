    title: Continuous and Emergency Ratings values
    description: |

      Each number in this array corresponds to a value of the continuous and
      emergency ratings for a particular period.  The first values correspond to
      the continuous (normal) rating and the subsequent values correspond to the
      emergency ratings in order of decreasing duration.  The durations are
      defined in the `proposal-header.default-emergency-durations` field.

      The exact number of values in this array is further determined by the
      `limit-type` parameter of the media type.
      ```http
      Content-Type: application/vnd.trolie.seasonal-ratings-proposal-slim.v1+json; limit-type=apparent-power
      ```
      If the [limit-type](#tag/limit-type) is single valued, like
      `apparent-power`, then the array will have a single value for each rating.
      For example, if there was only one emergency duration defined, then the
      array would have two values, e.g. `[50, 55]`, corresponding to a 50MVA
      continuous rating and 55MVA emergency rating, respectively. A
      single-valued limit type is anticipated to be the most common case in
      practice.

      However, if the [limit-type](#tag/limit-type) is `active-power` and the
      Clearinghouse Provider has required both MW and power factor, e.g.,
      `{"mw":1, "pf":1}`, then the array will have two values for each rating.
      If we continue with the example of having only one emergency duration
      defined, then the array would have four values.  Thus, instead of
      `[normal_MVA, emergency_MVA]`, we would have `[normal_MW, normal_pf,
      emergency_MW, emergency_pf]`, e.g., `[300, 1.0, 350, 1.0]`.
