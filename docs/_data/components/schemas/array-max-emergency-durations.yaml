  description: >
    A set of general limit or rating values, each mapped to the various limit
    bands defined by the Transmission Provider's 

    operating manual.  This typically consists of a "normal" limit, as well as
    limits for various levels of emergency conditions

    (typically 2-4) defined in the operations manual.  The list of supported limit
    types may be fetched from getSupportedLimitTypes.  

    The value of the limits are in units as defined by the X-TROLIE-Limit-Units
    header.
