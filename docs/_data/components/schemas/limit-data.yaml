      Optional list of quantities used as input to the ratings determination.
      The particular information exchange determines which values may be expected
      as well as the conventions used to represent those values. This property
      is included to prescribe a way to include these inputs but

            If the `value` is dimensionless, this property should not be
            provided. Since we are not specifying which inputs shall be
            provided, we cannot specify a definitive list of units, but
            implementors are encouraged to use UnitSymbol from CIM when
            appropriate: The CIM may not include appropriate units for
            all inputs, e.g., wind speed.
