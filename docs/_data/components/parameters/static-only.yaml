description: |

  Only return limits determined by static ratings.  Without this parameter a
  forecast limits snapshot would include contain limits determined by
  considering dynamic ratings, like AARs or DLRs, when those were available for
  a particular forecast period.

  With `static-only=true`, the forecast limits snapshot would only include
  limits that were determined using static ratings, such as seasonal ratings,
  seasonal overrides, temporary AAR exceptions, operator overrides, etc.
