    Pursuant to FERC Order 881, Transmission Providers are required to support
    Ambient Adjusted Ratings (AARs) for most Transmission Facilities in their
    footprint.  In this context, Transmission Providers refers roughly to the
    FERC definition of Transmission Provider as any public utility that owns,
    operates, or controls facilities used for the transmission of electric
    energy in interstate commerce.  This could be said to apply to any entity
    that operates the transmission grid, including ISOs.
    
    For the purpose of this API, Transmission Provider may be assumed to be more
    generic- it is really any entity that can receive AARs.  This API
    specification supports the information exchange necessary to coordinate
    forecasted and base facility ratings between a Transmission Provider and
    Ratings Providers.  The Transmission Provider is assumed to be the host of
    this information exchange.

    A Ratings Provider is defined by this specification to be any entity that
    has pre-coordinated with the Transmission Provider hosting this information
    exchange to be the entity responsible for providing AARs on some set of
    Transmission Facilities known to the Transmission Provider. That
    pre-coordination is out-of-scope for this specification.  The language of
    this API makes a strict distinction between the terms rating and limit.

    A limit is a validated value that is actively used to make operational
    decisions on the power grid.  This could be limits used by the EMS or
    real-time market in real-time, or it could be forecast limits used by
    look-ahead processes such as EMS study applications or the day-ahead market.

    A rating, in contrast, is a calculated value from some process that is input
    to TROLIE (and by extension operating power systems at large) and may be
    selected for use as a limit after validation and dependent on operating
    conditions, time frame and the operational decisions being made.  Seasonal
    ratings, forecast rating proposals, and real-time rating proposals are all
    examples of ratings.

  - name: Real-Time
    description: |

      At the discretion of the TROLIE server owner, Ratings Providers may use
      these functions to exchange ratings within the current hour, either as an
      alternative or supplement to traditional telemetry protocols such as ICCP.

      These are assumed to be real-time ratings, based on measurements of
      ambient conditions as opposed to forecasts.  These ratings will be used by
      Transmission Providers in real-time grid operations processes, such as
      state estimator and real-time markets.  The clearinghouse for real-time
      ratings may be run more frequently than the one for forecast ratings to
      adapt to real-world conditions.

      These ratings may be either AARs or DLRs.

  - name: Forecasting
    description: |

      The operations related to data exchange of forecasted ratings.

      This data exchange specifically includes the 240-hour-ahead forecasted AAR
      data exchange between Ratings Providers and Transmission Providers
      mandated FERC order 881.  It includes the ability to submit rating
      proposals, query back in-use limits, and monitor the health and validity
      of the rating proposal submissions relative the Rating Provider's
      obligations.

  - name: Seasonal
    description: |

      Seasonal ratings are static ratings associated with extended durations,
      typically months. These are used in both planning and operations.
      
      For Ratings Obligations with an AAR Exemption, the power system resource
      will be generally operated to a seasonal rating. For Ratings Obligations
      that *are* satisfied with dynamic ratings, a seasonal rating is still
      required, because the seasonal rating is typically used as a recourse
      rating when a dynamic rating is unavailable for any reason. For example, a
      dynamic rating would likely not be available during a communication outage
      or when determining a forecast rating for the power system resource beyond
      the period for which a forecast has been provided, e.g., beyond the ten
      day forecast required by FERC Order 881.

      A snapshot is provided of the resource ratings configured by the system,
      as well as their relationship to upcoming seasons.

  - name: Seasonal Overrides
    description: |

      A Seasonal Override is an instruction to use a temporary static rating set
      in lieu of any concurrent Seasonal Rating for a given segment.

      A typical use case is a so-called "de-rate" due to temporary clearance
      issue for a transmission facility that is exempt from providing AARs.
      Exempt facilities normally operate against a seasonal rating, yet rather
      than provide a seasonal ratings schedule update, the Ratings Provider
      could send a Seasonal Override. During the provided duration of the
      override, the Transmission Provider would operate to the Seasonal Override
      rather than any ratings that would have been used from the seasonal rating
      schedule.

      In contrast, for a segment that is *not* exempt from providing AARs, the
      Ratings Provider would issue a Temporary AAR Exception to the
      Clearinghouse Provider to address a clearance issue or other temporary
      operating condition that calls for a static rating.

  - name: Temporary AAR Exceptions
    description: >

      A TemporaryAARException is an exception to the AAR process, due to some
      unusual condition on the facility.  This could be caused by a number of
      scenarios:

      * An equipment failure.

      * An unforeseen condition on a related part of the power grid.

      * Some ambient condition that is not part of the model is heating the
        line.

      * Something in the surrounding environment is effecting the amount that a
      line is allowed to sag.  For example, this may occur for lines over rivers
      when very large ships pass under them. 

      The purpose and behavior of a temporary rating is two-fold.

      First, according to FERC, all exceptions to normal rating must be
      documented and kept with history.  The actual numbers for the forecasted
      and real-time feeds may still continue through proposals submitted to
      TROLIE. However, the presence of a temporary rating, and the reason that
      it occurred, must be captured in history regardless of the actual numbers.
      The TemporaryAARException may be held simply for that record- keeping
      purpose.  For the purpose of record-keeping, it may need to be updated
      after an incident has occurred with actual values.  The reason and the end
      date of the effective window may be updated after the object has been
      created, up to a configurable threshold.


      If the targeted segment is getting AAR data feeds, then it may be assumed
      that those AAR data feeds from the RatingsProvider will simply reflect the
      temporary condition.  However, this doesn't always apply, leading to the
      second usage.  Actual rating values may also be provided for the
      TemporaryAARException, when we cannot expect AAR feeds otherwise.  This
      occurs in two scenarios:

      1.  It is required when the Transmission Provider is generating forecast
      rating proposals, from lookup tables for example.  There is no external
      AAR data feed, and the Transmission Provider wouldn't otherwise know how
      to forecast the ratings given this temporary condition.  For these
      scenarios, a complete rating value set MUST be provided.

      2.  For facilities where AAR data is provided, it is possible that the AAR
      data feed could be down for some reason.  Therefore, this provides a
      placeholder set of numbers until the AAR data feed is repaired.

  - name: Monitoring Sets
    description: >      
      
      Monitoring Sets are named sets of power system resources that may be used to
      filter ratings and limits returned by queries against these APIs. How Monitoring
      Sets are defined is beyond the scope of the TROLIE specification, and it is
      assumed that the sender and receiver have predefined the appropriate Monitoring
      Sets.  More on monitoring sets may be found at https://trolie.energy/concepts.html#monitoring-sets
