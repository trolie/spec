    Pursuant to FERC Order 881, Transmission Providers are required to support

    Ambient Adjusted Ratings (AARs) for most Transmission Facilities in their
    footprint.  


    In this context, Transmission Providers refers roughly to the FERC
    definition of Transmission 

    Provider as any public utility that owns, operates, or controls facilities
    used for the

    transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce.  This could be said
    to apply to any entity that operates the transmission grid, including
    ISOs.  


    For the purpose of this API, Transmission Provider may be assumed to be more
    generic- it is 

    really any entity that can receive AARs.  


    This API specification supports the information exchange necessary to

    coordinate forecasted and base facility ratings between a Transmission
    Provider

    and Ratings Providers. 


    The Transmission Provider is assumed to be the host of this information
    exchange.


    A Ratings Provider is defined by this specification to be any entity that

    has pre-coordinated with the Transmission Provider hosting this information
    exchange

    to be the entity responsible for providing AARs on some set of Transmission
    Facilities

    known to the Transmission Provider. That pre-coordination is out-of-scope
    for

    this specification.


    The language of this API makes a strict distinction between the terms rating
    and limit.  

    A limit is a validated value that is actively used to make operational
    decisions on the power grid.  

    This could be limits used by the EMS or real-time market in real-time, or it
    could be forecast limits 

    used by look-ahead processes such as EMS study applications or the day-ahead
    market. 

    A rating, in contrast, is a calculated value from some process that is input
    to TROLIE 

    (and by extension operating power systems at large) and may be selected for
    use as a 

    limit after validation and dependent on operating conditions, time frame and
    the operational 

    decisions being made.  Seasonal ratings, forecast rating proposals, and
    real-time rating proposals are all examples of ratings.

  - name: Operating Snapshots
    description: >
      Two snapshots are provided:

      * **Operating Limits Forecast Snapshot** is the forecast of Transmission
        Facility ratings that is in-use by the Transmission Provider at the time
        of the request for this resource.  These are actively used for look-ahead operational decisions, such as the
        day-ahead market, in addition to their role as recourse limits if real-time ratings
        proposals are missing.  
      * **Operating Limits Real-Time Snapshot** is the set of System Operating
      Limits the
        Transmission Provider is operating to at the time of the request for
        this resource.  
  - name: Rating Proposals
    description: >
      Ratings Providers may submit ratings for three separate time horizons:

      * **Forecast Ratings** are at minimum hourly forecasts of ratings for a
      particular segment.  

      * **Real-Time Ratings** are provided for current operating conditions. 
      Ratings provided in this manner
        are an alternative for segments where ICCP communications are not available.  
      * **Seasonal Ratings** are recourse ratings for when applicable forecast
      ratings are not available.  
        In addition to use when forecast rating feeds are missing, these may be used by planning or other forward-looking
        processes that go beyond the window for which forecasted ratings may be available.  
        This includes ratings for scheduled calendar seasons, as well as to rating sets that apply in special named 
        scenarios defined by the Transmission Provider, such as an extreme winter day.  
  - name: Seasonal Rating Snapshots
    description: >
      While not typically used directly in operational decisions, seasonal
      ratings are provided for two purposes:

      1.  They are used when applicable forecast ratings are not available.  

      2.  They may be used in future-looking studies that look out (potentially
      far) beyond the time 
          window where forecast ratings are available.  
      A snapshot is provided of the resource ratings configured by the system,
      as well as their relationship to upcoming seasons.  

  - name: Temporary AAR Exceptions
    description: >
      A TemporaryAARException is an exception to the AAR process, due to some
      unusual

      condition on the facility.  This could be caused by a number of scenarios:

      * An equipment failure.

      * An unforeseen condition on a related part of the power grid.

      * Some ambient condition that is not part of the model is heating the
      line.

      * Something in the surrounding environment is effecting the amount that a
        line is allowed to sag.  For example, this may occur for lines over rivers when
        very large ships pass under them. 

      The purpose and behavior of a temporary rating is two-fold.


      First, according to FERC, all exceptions to normal rating

      must be documented and kept with history.  The actual numbers for the

      forecasted and real-time feeds may still continue through proposals
      submitted to 

      TROLIE. However, the presence of a temporary

      rating, and the reason that it occurred, must be captured in history
      regardless

      of the actual numbers.  The TemporaryAARException may be held simply for
      that record-

      keeping purpose.


      For the purpose of record-keeping, it may need to be updated after an

      incident has occurred with actual values.  The reason and the end date of
      the

      effective window may be updated after the object has been created, up to a

      configurable threshold.


      If the targeted segment is getting AAR data feeds, then it may be assumed
      that

      those AAR data feeds from the RatingsProvider will simply reflect the
      temporary

      condition.


      However, this doesn't always apply, leading to the second usage.  Actual
      rating

      values may also be provided for the TemporaryAARException, when we cannot
      expect AAR

      feeds otherwise.  This occurs in two scenarios:

      1.  It is required when the Transmission Provider is generating forecast
      rating proposals, 
          from lookup tables for example.  There is no external AAR data feed, and the 
          Transmission Provider wouldn't otherwise know
          how to forecast the ratings given this temporary condition.  For these
          scenarios, a complete rating value set MUST be provided.
      2.  For facilities where AAR data is provided, it is possible that the AAR
      data
          feed could be down for some reason.  Therefore, this provides a placeholder set
          of numbers until the AAR data feed is repaired.
  - name: Temporary Seasonal Ratings
    description: >
      A TemporarySeasonalRating allows for temporary overrides of the seasonal
      rating, due to some unusual

      condition on the facility.  This essentially overrides the current
      "recourse" rating used in operations.  



      NOTE- this description is likely incomplete, and needs to be added to in
      future releases.
