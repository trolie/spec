description: >
  RFC 3339 date-time string with *no fractional seconds component* that
  designates an operating period (such as an hour) that

  starts at a specified time. This will frequently be at the start of an hour,
  but may be finer-grained, such as 

  every 30 minutes, should the Transmission Provider choose.

  If the Transmission Provider is operating in EST, these are

  valid and equivalent values:

  * 2023-01-01T06:00Z

  * 2023-01-01T01:00-5:00

  * 2023-01-01T00:00-6:00

  * 2023-01-01T11:30+5:30


  The server should uniformly represent date-times in the operational time zone
  of the Transmission Provider.
