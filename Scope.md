# Scope

The TROLIE project establishes a communications specification for the exchange
of transmission ratings, operating limits, and associated information, including
but not limited to provenance information, ambient condition data, and other
details about how these ratings and limits were determined.   The communications
specification will include an API specification and guidelines for
implementation of the specification using web technologies.  The goal of the
project is to facilitate interoperability of software systems that must exchange
this information to support both real-time and forward operations of power
systems.

Ratings may apply to equipment such transformers, AC lines, series compensators,
etc. as well as other power systems objects like interfaces and zero impedance
busses. The ownership and entities assigned functional responsibility for these
objects may be exchanged along with details about the provenance of ratings and
limits.

Descriptive statistics and measures of historical accuracy related to the
communicated ratings and limits--such as moving averages, histograms, forecast
error, etc.--may also be exchanged.

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.
