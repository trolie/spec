  title: Transmission Facility Ratings and Operating Limits Information Exchange (TROLIE)
  description: |
    Pursuant to FERC Order 881, Transmission Providers are required to support
    Ambient Adjusted Ratings (AARs) for most Transmission Facilities in their footprint.  
    
    In this context, Transmission Providers refers roughly to the FERC definition of Transmission 
    Provider as any public utility that owns, operates, or controls facilities used for the
    transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce.  This could be said to apply to any entity that operates the transmission grid, including ISOs.  
    
    For the purpose of this API, Transmission Provider may be assumed to be more generic- it is 
    really any entity that can recieve AARs.  

    This API specification supports the information exchange necessary to
    coordinate forecasted and base facility ratings between a Transmission Provider
    and Ratings Providers. 

    The Transmission Provider is assumed to be the host of this information exchange.

    A Ratings Provider is defined by this specification to be any entity that
    has pre-coordinated with the Transmission Provider hosting this information exchange
    to be the entity responsible for providing AARs on some set of Transmission Facilities
    known to the Transmission Provider. That pre-coordination is out-of-scope for
    this specification.

    The language of this API makes a strict distinction between the terms rating and limit.  
    A limit is a validated value that is actively used to make operational decisions on the power grid.  
    This could be limits used by the EMS or real-time market in real-time, or it could be forecast limits 
    used by look-ahead processes such as EMS study applications or the day-ahead market. 
    A rating, in contrast, is a calculated value from some process that is input to TROLIE 
    (and by extension operating power systems at large) and may be selected for use as a 
    limit after validation and dependent on operating conditions, timeframe and the operational 
    decisions being made.  Seasonal ratings, forecast rating submittals, and real-time rating submittals are all examples of ratings.

    description: | 
      Monitoring sets are arbitrarily defined sets of network components, both segments and transmission facilities, 
      that may be used to filter ratings and limits returned by queries against this API.  These are stored sets that may be defined
      arbitrarily by users of the API, so long as those users have permission to view relevant components.  

  - name: Operating Snapshots
    description: |
      Two snapshots are provided:
      * **Operating Limits Forecast Snapshot** is the forecast of Transmission
        Facility ratings that is in-use by the Transmission Provider at the time
        of the request for this resource.  These are actively used for look-ahead operational decisions, such as the
        day-ahead market, in addition to their role as recourse limits if real-time ratings
        proposals are missing.  
      * **Operating Limits Real-Time Snapshot** is the set of System Operating Limits the
        Transmission Provider is operating to at the time of the request for
        this resource.  

  - name: Rating Proposals
    description: |
      Ratings Providers may submit ratings for three separate time horizons:
      * **Forecast Ratings** are at minimum hourly forecasts of ratings for a particular segment.  
      * **Real-Time Ratings** are provided for current operating conditions.  Ratings provided in this manner
        are an alternative for segments where ICCP communications are not available.  
      * **Seasonal Ratings** are recourse ratings for when applicable forecast ratings are not available.  
        In addition to use when forecast rating feeds are missing, these may be used by planning or other forward-looking
        processes that go beyond the window for which forecasted ratings may be availalbe.  
        This includes ratings for scheduled calendar seasons, as well as to rating sets that apply in special named 
        scenarios defined by the Transmission Provider, such as an extreme winter day.  

  - name: Seasonal Rating Snapshots
    description: |
      While not typically used directly in operational decisions, seasonal ratings are provided for two purposes:
      1.  They are used when applicable forecast ratings are not available.  
      2.  They may be used in future-looking studies that look out (potentially far) beyond the time 
          window where forecast ratings are available.  
      A snapshot is provided of the resource ratings configured by the system, as well as their relationship to upcoming seasons.  

  - name: Reference Data
    description: | 
      Reference to sets of data that are referenced by ratings, limits and monitoring sets.  This includes:
      * List of segments and transmission facilities defined in TROLIE's network model.  
      * From an IEC CIM perspective, the list of GeographicalRegions and SubGeographicalRegions defined in the model, and their 
        association to transmission facilities and segments.  
      * A list of supported seasons.  
      * A list of supported limit types.  
      * A list of supported naming schemes.  

  - name: Temporary AAR Exceptions
    description: |
      A TemporaryAARException is an exception to the AAR process, due to some unusual
      condition on the facility.  This could be caused by a number of scenarios:
      * An equipment failure.
      * An unforseen condition on a related part of the power grid.
      * Some ambient condition that is not part of the model is heating the line.
      * Something in the surrounding environment is effecting the amount that a
        line is allowed to sag.  For example, this may occur for lines over rivers when
        very large ships pass under them. 
    
      The purpose and behavior of a temporary rating is two-fold.
   
      First, according to FERC, all exceptions to normal rating
      must be documented and kept with history.  The actual numbers for the
      forecasted and real-time feeds may still continue through proposals submitted to 
      TROLIE. However, the presence of a temporary
      rating, and the reason that it occurred, must be captured in history regardless
      of the actual numbers.  The TemporaryAARException may be held simply for that record-
      keeping purpose.
     
      For the purpose of record-keeping, it may need to be updated after an
      incident has occurred with actual values.  The reason and the end date of the
      effective window may be updated after the object has been created, up to a
      configurable threshold.
     
      If the targeted segment is getting AAR data feeds, then it may be assumed that
      those AAR data feeds from the RatingsProvider will simply reflect the temporary
      condition.
      
      However, this doesn't always apply, leading to the second usage.  Actual rating
      values may also be provided for the TemporaryAARException, when we cannot expect AAR
      feeds otherwise.  This occurs in two scenarios:
      1.  It is required when the Transmission Provider is generating forecast rating proposals, 
          from lookup tables for example.  There is no external AAR data feed, and the 
          Transmission Provider wouldn't otherwise know
          how to forecast the ratings given this temporary condition.  For these
          scenarios, a complete rating value set MUST be provided.
      2.  For facilities where AAR data is provided, it is possible that the AAR data
          feed could be down for some reason.  Therefore, this provides a placeholder set
          of numbers until the AAR data feed is repaired.

  - name: Temporary Seasonal Ratings
    description: |
      A TemporarySeasonalRating allows for temorary overrides of the seasonal rating, due to some unusual
      condition on the facility.  This essentially overrides the current "recourse" rating used in operations.  
      
      
      NOTE- this description is likely incomplete, and needs to be added to in future releases.

        Note that the offset-period-start and period-end parameters work in a similar fashion to 
        getLimitsForecastSnapshot, except that it will return any proposal that overlaps with the implied period.

        and the `ETag` of a previous `GET` response.

          snapshot.  
        * *superseded* indicates that the proposal was superseded to a more conservative rating.  This rating may have 
          come from another party, as may be the case on jointly owned equipment or tie lines, or it may have come from a 
          topological condition on the network such that some related equipment is now forcing a more conservative limit.  
        * *overridden* indicates that the proposal was overridden manually by an operator for the Transmission Provider.

        starts at a specified time. This will frequently be at the start of an hour, but may be finer-grained, such as 
        every 30 minutes, should the Transmission Provider choose.
        If the Transmission Provider is operating in EST, these are
        valid and equivalent values:
        * 2023-01-01T06:00Z
        * 2023-01-01T01:00-5:00
        * 2023-01-01T00:00-6:00
        * 2023-01-01T11:30+5:30

        The server should uniformly represent date-times in the operational time zone of the Transmission Provider.
