  title: Transmission Facility Ratings and Operating Limits Information Exchange (TROLIE)
  description: |
    Pursuant to FERC Order 881, Transmission Providers are required to support
    Ambient Adjusted Ratings (AARs) for most Transmission Facilities in their footprint.  
    
    In this context, Transmission Providers refers roughly to the FERC definition of Transmission 
    Provider as any public utility that owns, operates, or controls facilities used for the
    transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce.  This could be said to apply to any entity that operates the transmission grid, including ISOs.  
    
    For the purpose of this API, Transmission Provider may be assumed to be more generic- it is 
    really any entity that can recieve AARs.  

    This API specification supports the information exchange necessary to
    coordinate forecasted and base facility ratings between a Transmission Provider
    and Ratings Providers. 

    The Transmission Provider is assumed to be the host of this information exchange.

    A Ratings Provider is defined by this specification to be any entity that
    has pre-coordinated with the Transmission Provider hosting this information exchange
    to be the entity responsible for providing AARs on some set of Transmission Facilities
    known to the Transmission Provider. That pre-coordination is out-of-scope for
    this specification.

    The language of this API makes a strict distinction between the terms rating and limit.  
    A limit is a validated value that is actively used to make operational decisions on the power grid.  
    This could be limits used by the EMS or real-time market in real-time, or it could be forecast limits 
    used by look-ahead processes such as EMS study applications or the day-ahead market. 
    A rating, in contrast, is a calculated value from some process that is input to TROLIE 
    (and by extension operating power systems at large) and may be selected for use as a 
    limit after validation and dependent on operating conditions, timeframe and the operational 
    decisions being made.  Seasonal ratings, forecast rating submittals, and real-time rating submittals are all examples of ratings.

    <b>HAL / HATEOAS Link Conventions</b>

    This API makes significant use of the REST HATEOAS pattern, using HAL conventions.  This means that relationships between resources
    are provided through links that are navigable through GET requests.  On submittal (POST, PUT or PATCH requests), this may be confusing when a particular
    relationship must be provided by the client.  The request bodies shall also include identifiers of the related elements.  Users shouldn't populate links- rather, these
    are populated by the system, and are fetchable on GET.  As shown in the example in `patchRatingForecastProposal`, `segmentX` may be referenced by setting 
    segment-id = segmentX.  When a Get for the same data, using `getRatingForecastsProposals`
    the href = /reference-data/network-segments/segmentX

  - name: Monitoring Sets
    description: | 
      Monitoring sets are arbitrarily defined sets of network components, both segments and transmission facilities, 
      that may be used to filter ratings and limits returned by queries against this API.  These are stored sets that may be defined
      arbitrarily by users of the API, so long as those users have permission to view relevant components.  

  - name: Operating Snapshots
    description: |
      Two snapshots are provided:
      * **Operating Limits Forecast Snapshot** is the forecast of Transmission
        Facility ratings that is in-use by the Transmission Provider at the time
        of the request for this resource.  These are actively used for look-ahead operational decisions, such as the
        day-ahead market, in addition to their role as recourse limits if real-time ratings
        proposals are missing.  
      * **Operating Limits Real-Time Snapshot** is the set of System Operating Limits the
        Transmission Provider is operating to at the time of the request for
        this resource.  

  - name: Rating Proposals
    description: |
      Ratings Providers may submit ratings for three separate time horizons:
      * **Forecast Ratings** are at minimum hourly forecasts of ratings for a particular segment.  
      * **Real-Time Ratings** are provided for current operating conditions.  Ratings provided in this manner
        are an alternative for segments where ICCP communications are not available.  
      * **Seasonal Recourse Ratings** are recourse ratings for when applicable forecast ratings are not available.  
        This includes ratings for scheduled calendar seasons, as well as to rating sets that apply in special named 
        scenarios defined by the Transmission Provider, such as an extreme winter day.  

  - name: Recourse Rating Snapshots
    description: |
      While not typically used directly in operational decisions, recourse ratings are provided for two purposes:
      1.  They are used when applicable forecast ratings are not available.  
      2.  They may be used in future-looking studies that look out (potentially far) beyond the time 
          window where forecast ratings are available.  
      A snapshot is provided of the resource ratings configured by the system, as well as their relationship to upcoming seasons.  

  - name: Reference Data
    description: | 
      Reference to sets of data that are referenced by ratings, limits and monitoring sets.  This includes:
      * List of segments and transmission facilities defined in TROLIE's network model.  
      * From an IEC CIM perspective, the list of GeographicalRegions and SubGeographicalRegions defined in the model, and their 
        association to transmission facilities and segments.  
      * A list of supported seasons.  
      * A list of supported limit types.  
      * A list of supported naming schemes.

        Note that the offset-period-start and period-end parameters work in a similar fashion to 
        getLimitsForecastSnapshot, except that it will return any proposal that overlaps with the implied period.

        and the `ETag` of a previous `GET` response.

        By default, all limits and ratings are assumed to be in megavolt-amperes (MVA).  However, TROLIE implementations _may_ support 
        alternative units, for both submittal and query, under the following circumstances:

        * Current (amps) may be used if the given segment or transmission facility has a nominal voltage configured in the model.  
          Conversion from/to MVA will be done assuming this nominal voltage.  Submittals in amps for segments without 
          a nominal voltage in amps will return null, and submittals in amps will not be allowed for such segments.  
        * A combination of actual power in megawatts (MW) and an assumed power factor (PF) in MW/MVA.  The MW and PF pairs must be offered together
          in submittals.  Queries for this form will return null for ratings/limits that were not originally submitted in this form.  

        The ability to negotiate limit units in this way is an optional feature of the TROLIE implementation.

        Enumeration of the possible statuses of a proposal, or parts of a proposal.  Note that submitals of proposals do not

        * *pending* indicates that the system has not yet processed this proposal.  
        * *accepted* indicates that the proposal has been accepted, and is now the basis for the associated ratings / limit
          snapshot.  
        * *superseded* indicates that the proposal was superseded to a more conservative rating.  This rating may have 
          come from another party, as may be the case on jointly owned equipment or tie lines, or it may have come from a 
          topological condition on the network such that some related equipment is now forcing a more conservative limit.  
        * *overridden* indicates that the proposal was overridden manually by an operator for the Transmission Provider.   
      enum:
        - pending
        - accepted
        - superseded
        - overridden

        will vary depending on their use.  CIM Master Resource Identifiers (mRIDs) may be used, as well
        as names used by the EMS or other systems.  The list of naming schemes supported, as well as the current default, 
        is a function of the TROLIE implementation.  All names of all transmission facilities are available in the getNetworkSegments and 
        getTransmissionFacilities operations.  The list of all naming conventions and the configured default is available in the 
        getNetworkNamingConventions operation.

    X-TROLIE-Limit-Units:
      description: |
        By default, all limits and ratings are assumed to be in megavolt-amperes (MVA).  However, TROLIE implementations _may_ support 
        alternative units, for both submittal and query, under the following circumstances:

        * Current (amps) may be used if the given segment or transmission facility has a nominal voltage configured in the model.  
          Conversion from/to MVA will be done assuming this nominal voltage.  Submittals in amps for segments without 
          a nominal voltage in amps will return null, and submittals in amps will not be allowed for such segments.  
        * A combination of actual power in megawatts (MW) and an assumed power factor (PF) in MW/MVA.  The MW and PF pairs must be offered together
          in submittals.  Queries for this form will return null for ratings/limits that were not originally submitted in this form.  

        The ability to negotiate limit units in this way is an optional feature of the TROLIE implementation.
