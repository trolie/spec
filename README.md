## To Specification Editors

The `docs/` folder contains a Jekyll site for the GH Pages along with the yaml
that is used with `redocly bundle` to create the OpenAPI specification.

To simplify the local setup of the toolchain, a devcontainer is provided. This
will also install VS Code extensions to help with local editing.

If your company uses MITM, self-signed certificates through your Internet proxy
and/or proxies upstream RubyGem or npm repos, please follow the instructions in
the next section to get the local devcontainer editing experience working.

### Self-Signed Certs and Repo Proxies

Put your company's self-signed cert in a PEM file at: `.devcontainer/root.pem`

You can use your company's RubyGem and npm proxies by specifying them in
`.devcontainer\devcontainer.json` by replacing:

```json
  "containerEnv": {
      "GEM_REPO": "https://rubygems.org",
      "NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY": "https://registry.npmjs.org"
  }
```
